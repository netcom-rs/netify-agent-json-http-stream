# Netify Agent DPI json http stream 

 This program is connecting to Netify Agent tcp socket and forwarding json data to http so you can use curl or other libraries to parse it more easily.


 Please replace NETIFY_HOST and NETIFY_PORT values so that it matches your environment.
 
 Default web server port is 8000. Path is HOST:PORT/api/v1/dpi/traffic (without trailing slash)

 Pull requests are welcome.

 Enjoy.

# TODO
 Argparse, so we can specify netify host and port in console.

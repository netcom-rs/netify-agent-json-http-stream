# Netify Agent DPI json http stream
# 

 This program is connecting to Netify Agent tcp socket and forwarding json data to http so you can use curl or other libraries to parse it more easily.


 Please replace NETIFY_HOST and NETIFY_PORT values so that it matches your environment.
 Default web server port is 8000.

 Enjoy.
